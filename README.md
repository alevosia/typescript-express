    Project Template
</p>
<p align="center">
    A pre-configured, configurable template that includes ESLint and Prettier
</p>

## Description

This template configures ESLint as both the linter and formatter.  
However, code that doesn't follow the Prettier configuration will appear as ESLint errors and will be fixed by ESLint.

Feel free to configure `.prettierrc` based on your preferences.

## How To Use

1. Create your own repo by clicking the green `Use this template` button beside the `Clone or download`.
2. Clone your own repo that Github created for you.
3. Start hacking!
